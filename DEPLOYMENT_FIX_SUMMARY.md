# PyPI Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
PyPI deployments were failing because the workflow was using username/password authentication with secrets, but PyPI has already been configured to use Trusted Publisher (OIDC) authentication.

## Solution
Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to use PyPI's Trusted Publisher feature:

### 1. Workflow Changes (`release.yml`)
- Added `environment: pypi` to the deploy-pypi job
- Added `permissions: id-token: write` for OIDC token generation
- Replaced manual twine upload with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`
- Removed deprecated `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` environment variables
- Fixed release notes path to use `release-notes/` directory

### 2. PyPI Configuration (Already Set)
- **Publisher Type**: GitHub
- **Repository**: JinsongRoh/pydoll-mcp
- **Workflow**: release.yml
- **Environment**: pypi

### 3. Benefits
- No more API token management
- Enhanced security with OIDC
- Automatic authentication between GitHub and PyPI
- Simpler deployment process

## Testing
The next release will automatically use the trusted publisher authentication. No secrets need to be configured in GitHub.

## GitHub Environment Setup Required
**IMPORTANT**: You need to create a GitHub environment named "pypi" in your repository settings:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Environments
2. Click "New environment"
3. Name it exactly "pypi" (lowercase)
4. Save the environment

This environment name must match the one configured in PyPI's trusted publisher settings.
