## üìã Next Steps for PyPI Deployment

### 1. Set up PyPI Credentials

First, you need to create an account on both TestPyPI and PyPI:
- TestPyPI: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/account/register/

Then, create API tokens:
1. Go to your account settings
2. Navigate to "API tokens"
3. Create a new token for uploading packages

### 2. Configure PyPI Access

Create a `~/.pypirc` file with your API tokens:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .pypirc.example ~/.pypirc

# Edit the file and add your tokens
nano ~/.pypirc
```

Replace `pypi-YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE` and `pypi-YOUR_TEST_API_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual tokens.

### 3. Test on TestPyPI First

Upload to TestPyPI to verify everything works:

```bash
# Using the virtual environment
.venv/bin/python publish.py --test
```

After successful upload, test the installation:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ pydoll-mcp
```

### 4. Deploy to PyPI

Once tested successfully on TestPyPI:

```bash
# Deploy to production PyPI
.venv/bin/python publish.py --prod
```

After deployment, users can install with:

```bash
pip install pydoll-mcp
```

## üîß Manual Upload Commands

If you prefer manual upload:

```bash
# For TestPyPI
.venv/bin/twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# For PyPI
.venv/bin/twine upload dist/*
```

## üì¶ Built Packages Location

The built packages are located in the `dist/` directory:
- `dist/pydoll_mcp-1.3.1-py3-none-any.whl`
- `dist/pydoll_mcp-1.3.1.tar.gz`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **License Warning**: The build process shows warnings about deprecated license format. This doesn't affect functionality but should be addressed in future versions by updating `pyproject.toml` to use SPDX license expression.

2. **Missing Files**: Some files mentioned in MANIFEST.in don't exist (like requirements-dev.txt, docs/, etc.). These warnings can be ignored or the MANIFEST.in can be updated.

3. **First Upload**: If this is the first time uploading to PyPI, make sure the package name "pydoll-mcp" is available.

## üéâ Ready for Deployment!

The package is built, tested, and ready for PyPI deployment. Follow the steps above to complete the deployment process.
