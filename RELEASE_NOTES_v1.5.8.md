# PyDoll MCP Server v1.5.8 Release Notes

**Release Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Version**: 1.5.8  
**Type**: Critical Tab Management Fix

## 🎯 Overview

PyDoll MCP Server v1.5.8 is a critical bug fix release that resolves fundamental tab management issues that were preventing proper browser automation. This release replaces hardcoded responses with actual tab management functionality, fixing navigation errors and "Tab not found" issues.

## 🔧 Critical Tab Management Fix

### ✅ Fixed Critical Issues

#### Tab Navigation Errors
- **Fixed**: `'Tab' object has no attribute 'navigate'` errors by using proper `tab.goto()` API
- **Enhanced**: Tab creation, closing, listing, and activation now work with real browser instances
- **Improved**: Navigation functions (`navigate_to`, `refresh_page`, `go_back`) properly access tracked tabs

#### Tab Management System
- **Fixed**: "Tab not found" errors by implementing actual tab management instead of hardcoded responses
- **Added**: Proper tab tracking and lifecycle management in browser instances
- **Enhanced**: Active tab tracking with fallback to first available tab

## 🚀 Browser-Tab Integration Improvements

### Real Implementation
- **Replaced**: All hardcoded dummy responses with actual tab management functionality
- **Added**: Tab ID generation and mapping for consistent browser-tab relationships
- **Enhanced**: Navigation tools to properly access tabs from browser instances

### Compatibility Layer
- **Added**: Compatibility layer for different PyDoll API versions
- **Improved**: Error handling for tab operations with detailed error messages
- **Enhanced**: Browser instance cleanup and resource management

## 📊 Technical Details

### What Was Fixed
- Tab management functions were returning hardcoded success responses

# Tab operations now work correctly
new_tab_id = new_tab(browser_id)
set_active_tab(browser_id, new_tab_id)
```
